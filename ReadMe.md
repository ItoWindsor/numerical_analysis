# Personal Project : Numerical Analysis in Rust 

![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white)

The goal of this project is to learn Rust through the implementation of different structures (complex numbers, matrices, ...) and algorithms (computation of the determinant of a matrice, solving a linear system through gauss Seidel)
