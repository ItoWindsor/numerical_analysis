# Roadmap 
Here shall be listed every elements I thoughts of for this project 

## Data Structures : 

### Matrices
- implementation as a struct 
    - representation of a matrice through basic types       
- methods associated : 
    - creation 
    - determinant 
    - eigenvalues 
    - eigenvectors 
- overloading of operators :
    - sum 
    - product
    - clone 
- handling errors : 
    - errors when summing two matrices of differentes sizes
